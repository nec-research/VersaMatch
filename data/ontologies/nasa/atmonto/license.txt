Release Terms, Information, and Acknowledgments
for the NASA Air Traffic Management Ontology

The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Air Traffic Management (ATM) ontology was developed as a key component of a semantic data integration system built to support integration, query, and search over multiple sources of heterogeneous ATM data, including data from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), NASA, and other non-governmental providers. In this data integration system, the ATM Ontology is used to bridge multiple types of aviation data models and enable cross-datasource querying; the ontology serves as the backbone upon which to overlay data from multiple sources. The ontology data model interconnects data from several different aviation realms, including flight, traffic management, aeronautical information, weather, and carrier operations.

This work was funded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration under the Aviation Operations and Safety Program.
