NASA Air Traffic Management Ontology

The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Air Traffic Management (ATM) ontology was developed as a key component of a semantic data integration system built to support integration, query, and search over multiple sources of heterogeneous ATM data, including data from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), NASA, and other non-governmental providers. In this data integration system, the ATM Ontology is used to bridge multiple types of aviation data models and enable cross-datasource querying; the ontology serves as the backbone upon which to overlay data from multiple sources. The ontology data model interconnects data from several different aviation realms, including flight, traffic management, aeronautical information, weather, and carrier operations.

This work was funded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration under the Aviation Operations and Safety Program.

The NASA Air Traffic Management Ontology incorporates data (provided under any applicable distribution terms and conditions) from the following sources, and NASA gratefully acknowledges their contribution:

-- Aircraft registration data (from FAA Aircraft Registry), public access
-- Traffic management advisories (from Air Traffic Control System Command Center), public access

- US Department of Transportation

    <dc:description>The ATM Ontology describes classes, properties, and relationships relevant to the domain of air traffic management, and represents information pertinent to a broad and diverse set of interacting components in the US and the global airspace, including flights, aircraft, manufacturers, airports, airlines, air routes, facilities, air traffic advisories, weather phenomena, and many others. There are three interrelated ontologies in the ATM Ontology suite: atmontoCore (https://data.nasa.gov/ontologies/atmontoCore), atmonto (https://data.nasa.gov/ontologies/atmonto), and atmontoPlus (https://data.nasa.gov/ontologies/atmontoPlus). The 'atmontoCore' ontology contains only classes and property definitions, but does not contain any class instances or property values. (This corresponds to the ATM Ontology's TBox, or terminological component.) The 'atmonto' ontology, which imports the 'atmontoCore' ontology, includes the aforementioned classes and property definitions, along with class instances and associated property values (i.e., TBox plus ABox fact assertions). In particular, the 'atmonto' ontology contains instances corresponding to relatively static, temporally-stable data pertaining to the US National AIrspace. Finally,the 'atmontoPlus' ontology imports the 'atmonto' ontology and adds additional instances covering a sample set of temporally-dependent flight, advisory, and weather data for the month of July 2014. (Due to volume considerations, only 100 flights from 15 July 2014 are included in this sample.) See the documentation at https://data.nasa.gov/ontologies/atmontoCore for further details.</dc:description>
